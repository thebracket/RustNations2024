We're going to go over a few of Rust's superpowers that make it such a great language to use for high-performance computing.

We're going to cover:

* **Drop** - the superpower *nobody* talks about.

This builds a background for *why* threading in Rust is so much fun, and so easy. This will be a quick primer---and then we'll dive into writing some threaded code.
